# Add-to-dix
Tools for easy adding to Apertium dictionaries for rule based translation. The main advantage is that the contributor doesn't have to edit the actual dictionaries, written in XML. A language-savvy wanting to contribute, might be deterred from contributing by the look of the XML-files and might make lots of trivial errors if he/she tries to edit the code.

The tools are made for adding to the old deprecated Apertium dictionaries for translation between Danish and Swedish (apertium-sv-da.sv etc). The modern dictionaries (apertium-swe.swe.dix etc) are completely new and of much better quality. An other advantage is that the new monodictionaries are independent of the language pairs. The old dictionaries where tailored for each par e.g. the Swedish dictionary for translation between Danish and Swedish was different from the one used when translation between Icelandic and Swedish. The latest dictionaries are available at https://github.com/apertium More information about Apertium at https://www.apertium.org/

As the Add-to-dix tools still are downloaded from my old site, I have made them available here - in the hope they will be useful for the contributors to Apertium. Some work is needed to update them:

- make them work with the new dictionaries for translation between Danish and Swedish
- make them work with other language pairs

The readme-file contains user instructions. A version in Swedish (for Swedes and Danes) is available as well: (readme.sv.txt).
The todo-file (Swedish) contains my old plans for developing the tools.
